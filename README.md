## Introduction

Gotta-Type-em-All! is a Pokemon-themed typing game built from scratch with Canvas HTML5, programmed with vanilla JavaScript, and styled with CSS3. To demonstrate mastery of JavaScript and front-end development, no other major technologies or libraries were used.

## Technologies

Gotta-Type-em-All! is coded primarily in JavaScript and runs on a game loop of 60 frames per seconds using requestAnimationFrames. Multiple layers of HTML5 Canvas renders the game with all objects or classes (Pokemon sprites, UI elements). CSS is applied to position and style UI elements including the input type field.

## Future Direction
* Add home screen with a Start button and How to Play elements.
* Add BGM / SFX.
* Leaderboard (backend) support, likely utilizing Google Firebase for storing user information and stats.
